# Capstone_Frontend

This is the front end portion of my Bright Network Technology Academy capstone project. For the backend please see here: https://github.com/RNWalker/capstone_backend_project .

This front end was designed to be used on an iPad or equivalent portable device, as the project was intended to be used by a warehouse worker that packs orders.

The homescreen of the project shows a dashboard of the number of orders that have been packed and the extent to which the warehouse trucks have already been filled with orders.

Using the pop-out sidebar on the left, a warehouse worker can navigate to orders that are outstanding, the order they are currently packing, and the status of each of the trucks. 

The order page shows the orders that are awaiting to be packed. Priority orders are put near the top of the page, and completed orders are ranked to the bottom.

When a warehouse packer presses 'pack order', they are assigned to the order in the database and the first truck with capacity to take the order is assigned to it.

Once the packer confirms all the items have been packed, they are directed to which truck to take the order to for delivery.
